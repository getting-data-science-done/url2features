abstract="The Web has long become a major platform for online criminal activities. URLs are used as the main vehicle in this domain. To counter this issues security community focused its efforts on developing techniques for mostly blacklisting of malicious URLs. While successful in protecting users from known malicious domains, this approach only solves part of the problem. The new malicious URLs that sprang up all over the web in masses commonly get a head start in this race. Besides that Alexa ranked trusted websites may convey compromised fraudulent URLs called defacement URL. In this work, we explore a lightweight approach to detection and categorization of the malicious URLs according to their attack type. We show that lexical analysis is effective and efficient for proactive detection of these URLs. We provide the set of sufficient features necessary for accurate categorization and evaluate the accuracy of the approach on a set of over 110,000 URLs. We also study the effect of the obfuscation techniques on malicious URLs to figure out the type of obfuscation technique targeted at specific type of malicious URL.",
