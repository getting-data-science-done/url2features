Whatâ€™s in a Domain? Anaylsis of URL Features

Many data science problems require processing log data derived
from web pages, APIs or other Internet traffic sources. URLs are
one of the few ubiquitous data fields that describe internet activity,
hence they require effective processing for a wide variety of
machine learning applications. While URLs are structurally rich,
they are not subject to universal principles of construction making
feature engineering for internet data an ongoing challenge.

In this research we outline the key categories of information
structure in domains and URLs. We share an open source implementation
of these ideas and demonstrate their utility across a range of
Internet traffic machine learning problems. Python package available
